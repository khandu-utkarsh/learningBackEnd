# Simple Functional Event Loop

This repository contains a Python package for implementing a simple event loop, along with a client and server for demonstration purposes.

**TODO:** While the package is functional and structured for easy installation, it is not yet fully set up for installation. Further configuration is required.

## Overview

The event loop package provides an interface for:
- Registering timers with callbacks.
- Creating and managing sockets with I/O multiplexing for efficient monitoring.

## Purpose

I built this project to deepen my understanding of Python and event-driven programming. I refactored existing code from a blog post ([iximiuz.com](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/explain-event-loop-in-100-lines-of-code/)) into a modular structure, added type annotations, and provided detailed docstrings. This process helped me better understand Python internals and the workings of the original code.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided server and client scripts to see the event loop in action. These examples illustrate how to schedule tasks and handle I/O operations with minimal resource consumption.
